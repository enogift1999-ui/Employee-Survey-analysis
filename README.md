## KEY MATRICS
Key Metrics
- Highest Agreement: “I know what is expected of me at work” – 92.61%
- Lowest Agreement / Highest Disagreement: “I have a best friend at work” – 47.57% disagreement
- Department Patterns: HR, Communications, Exec Office = strong performers; Sheriff’s Department = lowest satisfaction
- Role Patterns: Directors & Managers = higher agreement; Staff = lowest satisfaction

## SKILLS & CONCEPTS

- SQL Queries in pgAdmin (aggregation, grouping, filtering, case logic)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Survey Analytics (agreement/disagreement scoring, percentage breakdowns)
- Data Storytelling (insights, patterns, recommendations)

## ANALYSIS 
The employee engagement survey results were analyzed to determine which questions respondents agreed or disagreed with most, and to uncover trends by department and role. Agreement was defined as selecting “Agree” or “Strongly Agree”, while disagreement was defined as “Disagree” or “Strongly Disagree”. Responses marked “Not Applicable” were excluded to ensure meaningful comparisons.

The analysis revealed that the strongest area of agreement was role clarity. Specifically, 92.61% of respondents agreed with the statement “I know what is expected of me at work”. This indicates that organizational communication regarding responsibilities is effective and well-understood. Other highly positive results included supervisor care (86.41% agreement) and departmental inclusivity (83.30%). These findings highlight a culture of support and diversity within parts of the organization.

However, the weakest areas of employee experience were recognition, accountability, and workplace relationships. Nearly half (47.57%) disagreed with “I have a best friend at work”, reflecting limited interpersonal connections. Similarly, 34.79% disagreed with “In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work”. Accountability was also flagged, with 25% of respondents disagreeing that their supervisors hold employees accountable.

Patterns by department revealed that Human Resources, Communications, and the Executive Office consistently scored high in inclusivity and supervisor support, while operational units like the Sheriff’s Department reported much lower satisfaction levels, with agreement often falling below 50%. Role-based analysis showed Directors and Managers report higher satisfaction with strategic clarity and mission importance, whereas Staff members expressed greater dissatisfaction with recognition, accountability, and job satisfaction.

Taken together, the results suggest that while the organization excels in defining expectations and fostering inclusivity, it faces challenges in building recognition systems, ensuring accountability, and supporting workplace relationships. These gaps are most pronounced among frontline staff and in operational departments.
